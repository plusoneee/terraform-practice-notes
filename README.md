# Terraform Practice Notes
This repository contains my personal notes on learning Terraform and a collection of Terraform code examples.


## Directory Structure
The repository is organized into multiple directories, each containing Terraform code files and a README.md file that provides instructions and information about how to use the Terraform code in that directory:
* `hosts-setup`: Contains all Terraform files related to host setup and configuration.
* `jenkins-container`: Contains all Terraform files related to a Jenkins container.

Please read the relevant README.md file in each directory before using the Terraform code. This will provide you with more information on how to use the code and what to expect when running it.

## Installing Terraform

Before using the Terraform code in this repository, you need to install Terraform first. Here's how:

1. Refer to the official [Terraform official website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) for installation instructions based on your operating system.
2. Open a terminal and run the following command to verify that Terraform is installed correctly:
  ```
  terraform version
  ```
If everything is working properly, you should see the version information of Terraform. 

That's it!
